"""
This is a high level driver for the EPOS tilt controller for the PoliV2 platform.
This file also launches a script that moves the pan/tilt/pillar/led systems for visual inspection.

The specific purpose of this driver is to ensure that the tilt motor's position encoders 
have been initialized properly. The encoders are set on power-on to the motor.

This driver checks if the tilt LIMIT SWITCH is pressed.
If so, it launches the tilt driver and checks the reported position of its encoders.
If its position value reports 0.0 +/- TOLERANCE the driver is kept alive.
If its out of TOLERANCE the driver is killed, error messages are logged, and this driver exits.

There is a persistance parameter INIT_PARAM that is used to track if this driver has been run since 
the robot has been started. This assumes that the tilt motor's power is tied exclusively with the 
rest of the robot.
